# 🌐 Blockchain-Based Tax and Expenditure System 💰

This project implements a blockchain-based system that demonstrates key blockchain concepts such as immutability, transparency, and decentralization, applied to a taxation and government expenditure model. The application allows users to simulate tax payment under the salary clause, visualize government expenditures, and detect tampering in blockchain data.

## 📜 Project Overview

The **Blockchain-Based Tax and Expenditure System** simulates a simplified tax collection process using blockchain technology. The system focuses on salary-based tax payment, government expenditure distribution, and blockchain concepts such as hashing, block validation, and tamper detection. Each transaction is recorded as a block in the blockchain, ensuring **transparency** and **immutability**.

### Key Features 🚀

- **Blockchain Transparency**: All tax transactions are recorded in a decentralized blockchain, ensuring transparency in tax payment and government expenditure.
- **Tamper Detection**: If any block is tampered with, the hash changes, turning the block red, signaling tampering.
- **Block Validation (Mining)**: New blocks are only added to the chain if their hash starts with `0000`, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain.
- **Data Anonymity**: The user’s salary and tax amounts are stored without revealing sensitive information.
- **Tax and Expenditure Calculation**: Taxes are grouped based on salary ranges and allocated to different government sectors.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Blockchain Structure**: 
   - The blockchain starts with a "Genesis Block" and subsequent blocks are added by mining. Each block stores tax information like salary and calculated tax.
   - The hash of each block is calculated using the SHA-256 algorithm to ensure data integrity.

2. **Tamper Detection**: 
   - When a block's data is tampered with, the hash changes, and the block turns red to indicate tampering.
   - The system also revalidates subsequent blocks to maintain blockchain integrity.

3. **Tax Calculation**:
   - Users can submit their salary, and the system calculates the tax at a rate of 5%.
   - Taxes are then grouped into categories based on the salary range: 
     - Below ₹2.5 Lakh
     - ₹2.5 Lakh to ₹5 Lakh
     - ₹5 Lakh to ₹10 Lakh
     - Above ₹10 Lakh

4. **Government Expenditure Distribution**:
   - Tax revenue is distributed across various government sectors such as Healthcare, Education, Defense, and Infrastructure, based on predefined percentages.

## 💡 Key Concepts Implemented

### 1. **Immutability** 🔒
Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered. If any changes are made, the hash of the block changes, and the system highlights it as tampered.

### 2. **Mining & Validation** ⛏️
Blocks are mined using a Proof-of-Work mechanism. A new block is valid only if its hash starts with `0000`. This prevents invalid or malicious blocks from being added to the blockchain.

### 3. **Transparency** 📊
Every user can view the blockchain, including the taxes collected and the government’s expenditure. This ensures complete transparency in tax management.

### 4. **Anonymity** 🕵️‍♂️
Users' tax data (such as salary) is stored in a decentralized manner, ensuring privacy and security of individual financial information.

## 🚀 Features to Explore

- **Submit Tax** 💸: Allows users to submit their salary and calculates the tax amount.
- **Government Expenditure** 💼: Displays how the collected tax is distributed across various government sectors.
- **Blockchain Visualization** 🔗: Shows the blockchain structure and highlights tampered blocks in red.
- **Tamper Data** 🔴: Simulates tampering with a block and demonstrates how the system detects tampering.

## 🌟 Innovative Blockchain Simulation

This project showcases the core concepts of blockchain technology using a creative and innovative approach. Unlike traditional blockchain frameworks like **Ganache** and **Truffle**, which are typically used to simulate blockchain environments, this project is fully implemented using **Python**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

Instead of relying on external simulators, the entire blockchain process — from **block creation** and **hash generation** to **tampering detection** — is simulated and visualized directly within the app itself. The blocks change color to indicate tampering, and the block validation (mining) is managed using custom logic built in Python.

This approach not only demonstrates a deeper understanding of blockchain principles but also offers a highly customizable and lightweight solution without the need for heavy external dependencies. It’s a perfect example of how fundamental blockchain concepts can be brought to life using basic tools, offering both simplicity and creativity.

By building everything from scratch, this project is a great example of innovation, focusing on **transparency**, **security**, and **validation** in a user-friendly, custom-built blockchain simulation!

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the project, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- hashlib (for hashing and encryption)
- JSON (for data handling)

## 🔴 Demonstrating Block Tampering

To showcase the security of the blockchain, a **tampering simulation** is included. By entering a block number and new data in JSON format through the **tamper button**, users can visually see how the block turns **red** when its data is altered, highlighting the integrity check mechanism of the blockchain.

### Example of Data for Tampering

To simulate tampering, enter the following data in JSON format:

**Block Number**: 3  
**Data** (in JSON format):

sh

     {
        "salary": 800000,
        "amount": 40000,
        "timestamp": "2024-11-26 11:00:00"
      }



## ⚡ How to Run the Project
